# Infrastructure (infra)

Stage: repository skeleton

Holds Docker/Compose overrides, IaC snippets, migration helpers, and operational scripts. As infra grows, this README will capture environment setup instructions and runbooks.

## Todo
- [ ] Define compose overrides for prod-like deployments
- [ ] Add migration/seeding scripts and data packs
- [ ] Capture observability stack plans (logging/metrics)
- [ ] Document Portainer usage + guardrails
