# API Service (apps/api)

Stage: repository skeleton

This folder will host the ASP.NET Core solution using a clean architecture split (Domain/Application/Infrastructure/API). Upcoming work will add the solution files, EF Core migrations, repository/unit-of-work abstractions, and seed tooling.

## Todo
- [ ] Initialize solution + projects
- [ ] Configure EF Core with PostgreSQL provider
- [ ] Add base repository + unit of work pattern
- [ ] Scaffold CQRS + event publishing integration
- [ ] Write README updates when milestones are completed
