# Testing Utilities (packages/testing)

Stage: repository skeleton

Cross-cutting testing helpers, fixtures, and builders for API + client projects. Intended to keep test code DRY and aligned.

## Todo
- [ ] Pick shared runtime (TypeScript/.NET dual? separate subfolders)
- [ ] Add data builders + sample payload generators
- [ ] Provide reusable mocks (HTTP servers, message bus fakes)
- [ ] Document how each app consumes these helpers
