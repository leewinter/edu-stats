# UI Library (packages/ui)

Stage: repository skeleton

Shared React component library consumed by any client applications. Will be published locally via workspace tooling (e.g., pnpm workspaces or turborepo) once the tooling is introduced.

## Todo
- [ ] Decide on workspace manager and build tooling
- [ ] Scaffold component package (TS, Storybook optional)
- [ ] Establish design tokens + shared styles
- [ ] Add unit + visual regression tests
- [ ] Document usage and release instructions
