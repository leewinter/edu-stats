I need to build a new system designed to repot off a sql database with big data. The data is information about higher education statistics.

I would like the api layer to be .net

I would like the client to be react. I would like my components in a separate component library. I think some client cache makes sense like tanstack

I would like the database to be sql server, mysql, or postgress (Im going to use ef core). 
I would like the database hosted via a docker container for simplicity. 
I expect I'll use the repository pattern (generic base repo) with unit of work .
I want the database to be setup via migrations from scratch, and maintained this way. For dev purpose it would be nice for each table to have a seed script that helps for testing

Since the data could be big I would like event driven architecture. Possibly CQRS with some sort of cache

I would like the whole project span up via docker compose for simplicity

As I go I would like to ensure all projects in my monorepo have readme markdown files documenting the stages

I would like to use git imperative commits and tackle each part of the system in small feature branches

I want unit tests where possible and e2e tests when I have a docker compose for eveything.
Is it also possible to add portainer to the docker compose and only spin it up if an instance of portainer isnt already running on the machine already?
